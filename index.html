            <p>The journey of life has brought me to an inflection point, and landed me in the 3-month coding bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. For the first time in a long time, I feel as if my efforts are driving me in the right direction. Although it took me longer than I would have liked, I was able to determine that an education in technology, and more specifically web development, was the right choice for me. I'm happy to be here, and am hopeful for my future in coding. </p>

            <p>I was born and raised in Syracuse, NY. I have a variety of interests including fitness, basketball, video games, and science & technology.</p>
